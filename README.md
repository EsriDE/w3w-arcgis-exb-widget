## How to use this widget
Clone the sample repo into your Experience Builder Client root folder and restart your watcher.

## About
This is a widget developed for demonstration purposes at Esri Deutschland, using the what3words REST API 

## Ideas for further development
* search by text input, i.e. the geocoding of a three-word address (maybe use the w3w Locator Services instead of the REST API + JSAPI Search widget to take advantage of the built-in suggest functionality)
* convert selected vertices or point features to three-word addresses
* check which features are in the clicked 3x3 meter square
